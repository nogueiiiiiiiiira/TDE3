# TODO List for README Enhancement

## Tasks to Complete
- [ ] Add Pseudocode Section: Include pseudocode for Dining Philosophers (with and without deadlock), Concurrent Counter (with and without semaphore), and Deadlock Demo (with and without correction).
- [ ] Add Evaluation Criteria Mapping: Detail how each evaluation criterion is met, with references to specific code locations (files, classes, methods, lines).
- [ ] Enhance Explanations: Ensure all sections reference exact code locations where concepts are implemented (e.g., hierarchy in Filosofo.java, semaphore in ContadorConcorrente.java).
- [ ] Verify Completeness: Cross-check against task requirements to ensure all deliverables are covered in README.
- [ ] Final Review: After edits, confirm README aligns with task criteria.
