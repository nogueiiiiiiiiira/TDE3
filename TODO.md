- [x] Add Evaluation Criteria Mapping: Detail how each evaluation criterion is met, with references to specific code locations (files, classes, methods, lines).
- [x] Enhance Explanations: Ensure all sections reference exact code locations where concepts are implemented (e.g., hierarchy in Filosofo.java, semaphore in ContadorConcorrente.java).
- [x] Verify Completeness: Cross-check against task requirements to ensure all deliverables are covered in README.
- [x] Final Review: After edits, confirm README aligns with task criteria.
- [ ] Remove // comments from README code blocks.
- [ ] Enhance with precise code locations (e.g., method names, line numbers).
- [ ] Update TODO.md after completion.
